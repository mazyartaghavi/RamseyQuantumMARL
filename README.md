#  Ramsey-Guided Quantum Optimization for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a hybrid approach to intelligent forest surveillance using **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. We incorporate **Ramsey Theory** for structured exploration and **Quantum-Inspired Optimization (QIO)** to efficiently coordinate 10 UAV agents in a partially observable forest environment.

##  Project Description

In real-world forest surveillance, agents must deal with:
- Sparse, unpredictable events (e.g., illegal logging, fire indicators)
- Partial observability and dynamic environments
- Large and complex coordination spaces

This project addresses the **exploration-exploitation tradeoff** by:
- Using **Ramsey Theory** to guide exploration toward agent cliques likely to yield structured, high-reward behaviors.
- Applying **Quantum-Inspired Optimization** (QIO) techniques to allocate agents to regions or coordination subgroups efficiently.

##  Key Concepts

- **Ramsey Theory**: Ensures that in any sufficiently complex system, structured patterns (agent cliques) will emerge.
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Agents learn cooperative policies for high reward under partial observability.
- **Quantum Optimization**: Uses QUBO or QAOA to solve combinatorial assignment problems efficiently.
